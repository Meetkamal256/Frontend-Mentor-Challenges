Single Price Grid Component

About The Project
In this challenge, you will build out the pricing component to the designs provided. This is perfect for beginners and people who want to complete a smaller challenge. The main challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow

What I learned
The project was fun to build and did not require a lot of experience. I improved my flexbox skills a bit more but definitely still a lot to learn about it.
